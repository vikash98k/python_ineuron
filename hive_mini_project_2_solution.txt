Problem Statement - New York City is a thriving metropolis and just like most other cities of similar size, one of the biggest problems its residents face is parking. The classic combination of a huge number of cars and a cramped geography is the exact recipe that leads to a large number of parking tickets.
 
In an attempt to scientifically analyse this phenomenon, the NYC Police Department regularly collects data related to parking tickets. This data is made available by NYC Open Data portal. We will try and perform some analysis on this data.

Note: Consider only the year 2017 for analysis and not the Fiscal year.

The analysis can be divided into two parts:
 
Part-I: Examine the data

1.) Find the total number of tickets for the year.
select count(*) from parking_data_orc where issue_date like '%/2017';
ans: 

2.) Find out how many unique states the cars which got parking tickets came from.
select count(distinct state) from parking_data_orc;
ans: 95

3.) Some parking tickets donâ€™t have addresses on them, which is cause for concern. Find out how many such tickets there are(i.e. tickets where either "Street Code 1" or "Street Code 2" or "Street Code 3" is empty )
select count(*) from parking_data_orc where street_code_1== '' or street_code_2== '' or street_code_3== '';
ans: 0


Part-II: Aggregation tasks

1.) How often does each violation code occur? (frequency of violation codes - find the top 5)
select violation_code, count(*) as frequency from parking_data_orc group by violation_code order by frequency desc limit 5;
ans: 21	1528577
     36	1400614
     38	1062302
     14	893493
     20	618592
     Time taken: 6.57 seconds, Fetched: 5 row(s)

     
2.) How often does each vehicle body type get a parking ticket? How about the vehicle make? (find the top 5 for both)
select vehicle_body_type, count(*) as frequency from parking_data_orc group by vehicle_body_type order by frequency desc limit 5;
ans: SUBN	3719796
     4DSD	3082006
     VAN	1411964
     DELV	687324
     SDN	438191
     Time taken: 6.503 seconds, Fetched: 5 row(s)
     
select vehicle_make, count(*) as frequency from parking_data_orc group by vehicle_make order by frequency desc limit 5;
ans: FORD	1280956
     TOYOT	1211447
     HONDA	1079237
     NISSA	918590
     CHEVR	714654
     Time taken: 6.448 seconds, Fetched: 5 row(s)
     
     
3.) A precinct is a police station that has a certain zone of the city under its command. Find the (5 highest) frequencies of:
      a.) Violating Precincts (this is the precinct of the zone where the violation occurred)
      select violation_precinct, count(*) as frequency from parking_data_orc where violation_precinct is not null group by violation_precinct order by frequency desc limit 5;
      ans: 0	2072400
           19	535671
           14	352450
           1	331810
           18	306920
           Time taken: 6.456 seconds, Fetched: 5 row(s)


      
      b.) Issuer Precincts (this is the precinct that issued the ticket)
      select issuer_precinct, count(*) as frequency from parking_data_orc where issuer_precinct is not null group by issuer_precinct order by frequency desc limit 5;
      ans: 0	2388475
           19	521513
           14	344977
           1	321170
           18	296554
           Time taken: 6.459 seconds, Fetched: 5 row(s)


4.) Find the violation code frequency across 3 precincts which have issued the most number of tickets - do these precinct zones have an exceptionally high frequency of certain violation codes?
select issuer_precinct, count(violation_code) as f  from parking_data_orc where issuer_precinct=0 or issuer_precinct= 19  or issuer_precinct= 14 and violation_code is not null group by issuer_precinct  order by f desc;
ans: 0	2388475
19	521507
14	344975
Time taken: 6.5 seconds, Fetched: 3 row(s)
ans: Yes
