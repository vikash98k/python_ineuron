Data Warehouse ->
                it store huge amount of data.[TB size] ,Historical data
                it represents data in structured format
                example - > Hive, Snowflake,Aws Redshift

Benefits of Data Warehouse ->
                            1) Better Business analysis
                            2) Faster Queries
                            3) Improved Data Quality
                            4) Historical Insight
                            
Example Applications of Data Warehousing ->
1)Banking
2) Government
3) Social Media Websites


Data Warehouse Architecture--> 3 tier

1) Bottom Tier
2) Middle Tier
3) Top Tier

1) Bottom Tier --> It consists of data Warehouse server,usually a relational database system
                    It transform data from multiple data sources through a process known as Extract,Transform,Load(ETL)/ELT

2) Middle Tier --> OLAP (i.e. online analytical processing)
               --> Three types of OLAP models can be used in this tier, which are known as ROLAP, MOLAP and HOLAP.
               -->The type of OLAP model used is dependent on the type of database system that exists.

3) Top Tier --> It is front-end user interface or reporting tool
                which enables end users to conduct ad-hoc data analysis on their business data.


OLAP --> online analytical processing
     --> OLAP tools are designed for multidimensional analysis of data in a data warehouse,
        which contains both historical and transactional data.
     -->Common uses of OLAP include data mining and other business intelligence applications,
        complex analytical calculations, and predictive scenarios,
        as well as business reporting functions like financial analysis, budgeting, and forecast planning.

OLTP --> Online transaction processing
     --> It support transaction-oriented applications by processing recent transactions as quickly and accurately as possible.
     --> Common uses of OLTP include ATMs, e-commerce software, credit card payment processing, online bookings, reservation systems, and record-keeping tools.


DataLake -- > its allow use to store structured or un structured data at any scale.
        example - > HDFS, AWS s3,Azure blob ,GCP storage.

Data Mart --> A data mart is a subset of a data warehouse
          --> It contain a smaller subset of data
